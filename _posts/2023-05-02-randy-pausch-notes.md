These are my notes from [Randy Pausch's Time Management lecture](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blaK_tB_KQA) he gave at Old Cabell Hall at UVA in 2007. My sister was in the audience as a fourth year student. I wasn't a student yet!

If you've never heard of Randy, I really recommend watching the video, but you can also read [the PDF](https://www.cs.virginia.edu/~robins/Randy/RandyPauschTimeManagement2007.pdf) of his lecture. 

[Here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randy_Pausch) is a link to his Wikipedia page.

#### TLDR
- **Randy claims that poor time management causes stress**


#### Difficult tasks
- If you have to eat a frog, don't spend a lot of time looking at it first
  - If you have to eat three of them, don't start with the small one
  - "If you have a lot of things to do, do the ugliest thing first"

#### Prioritization
- He referenced Steven Covey's Four-quardrant TODO method, saying to prioritize 4 tasks as follows:

|   |   Due Soon    | Not Due Soon |
|:--------:|:-------------:|:------------:|
| Important | 1 | 2 |
| Not Important | 3 | 4 |


#### The low hanging fruit
- Apparently, people spend 28 hours a week watching TV or otherwise "wasting time". Randy says to cut it out.
- I wonder whether this is sustainable to completely remove downtime.


#### Misc
- Impostor Syndrome
  - When asked about his teaching peers, he said, "damn, these are smart people! And I snuck in!"
